# Tweets Search Streamlit App

This app allows users to search for tweets on a particular hashtag. Users can enter the hashtag they are interested in searching and the maximum number of results they want to fetch.

The app then makes API calls to the Twitter API using the Tweepy library to search for recent tweets containing that hashtag and retrieve count data for the number of tweets over the past 7 days.

It displays the tweet count chart and up to the specified number of recent tweets containing that hashtag. It shows the username and tweet text for each result.

Users can adjust the number of results and search for different hashtags to explore different topics on Twitter. This app streamlines searching and analyzing trends on Twitter hashtags.
